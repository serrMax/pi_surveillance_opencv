Taking one of my old projects, PiCamStream(https://github.com/serrMax/pi_cam_stream), to the next level.
<br><br>
Staring at a stream with no action(trying to catch my nephews and nieces red-handed) was really boring, so I decided to just automate everything! 😎
<br><br>
Security feed(which is optional of course) with motion detection(opencv)...
<br><br>

<br><br>
and ...
<br><br>
I can catch them in the act of "crime" immediately ...

<br><br>
and the cherry on top is the lightning fast email notification with the image of the intruder (_evil laugh_)
